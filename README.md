# Design by Luna Farchakh

Hello! I am Luna and this is my design portfolio. I focus on interior design for spaces such as hotels, art workshops and private residences. If you find it charming, don't hesitate to get in touch! 

## Updating this Portfolio

If you happen to fork and re-use this portfolio because you like it, simply add your pictures within the `images` folder. `fulls` should contain the complete image that shows up when you click, while `thumbs` contains the thumbnails shown while browsing the page. You can describe the pictures by editing the `captions.json` file in the `assets` folder directly on Github! If you want to add additional content like I did with my CV and Portfolio, simply place them in the `assets` folder.

## License and Original Work

This portfolio was built on top of [Ram Patra's Photography](https://github.com/rampatra/photography) and maintains the same license, GPL3. All posterior editions to the code were made by Nur A.G., while the pictures showcase my own design except otherwise specified.
